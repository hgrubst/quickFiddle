#Quick fiddle

Quick fiddle is a html/js/css fiddler that includes the following : 
- angular
- bootstrap
- animate.css
- less
- bower

It is meant to be used as a playground for html/js/css experiments, somewhat similar to what js fiddle would do.
Because all resources use bower, after running `bower install` a first time, the site can work offline.

##Usage
- clone the git repo : `git clone git@github.com:hgrubst/quickFiddle.git`
- run `bower install`
- run a http server to serve index.html (eg use python -m SimpleHTTPServer, or node http-server or whatever you like).
